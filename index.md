Not a site about Wisconsin supper clubs, but if you did want to know more about supper clubs in Wisconsin there is a [nice book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16000410) and a [guide on the Travel Wisconsin site](https://www.travelwisconsin.com/dining/supper-clubs).

If you're a Wisconsinite and looking for a home on the Fediverse, please [reach out via email](mailto:matt.gauger@gmail.com).
